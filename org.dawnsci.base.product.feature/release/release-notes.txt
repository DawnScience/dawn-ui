RELEASE NOTES FOR DAWN 2.3.0

1. Use the '-data' switch to specify a different workspace if the disk access at your facility
   is slow or restricted in the default location. 
   For instance: dawn -data /scratch/dawn_workspace

2. Toolbar actions on linux can be hidden using the plotting. If the part becomes small, instead 
   of wrapping, some toolbar actions disappear. They can normally be found on the menu to the 
   right of the toolbar (the white down arrow).

3. To reliably find the Dawn version you are using go to:
   * Help->About Dawn.
