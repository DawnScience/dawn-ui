RELEASE NOTES FOR DAWN 2.1.0

1. Use the '-data' switch to specify a different workspace if the disk access at your facility
   is slow or restricted in the default location. 
   For instance: dawn -data /scratch/dawn_workspace

2. Toolbar actions on linux can be hidden using the plotting. If the part becomes small, instead 
   of wrapping, some toolbar actions disappear. They can normally be found on the menu to the 
   right of the toolbar (the white down arrow).

3. To reliably find the Dawn version you are using go to:
   * Help->About Dawn.

New features:
---------------
- Pydev update:
- Iso-Surface / Volume Renderer: Reset transform button added, non indices axes support, screenshot/print enabled. 
- FileViewer: sorting of files and folders.
- NCD Processing: calculation of crystallite thickness T parameter.
- Dataset Concatenation processing operation: works for two dimensional datasets and takes into account axes properly.
- XAS Sample Calculation tool: get transmission and optical depth profiles as well as quick predictions
	of X-ray fluorescence experiments, with support for escape peaks and scattering. Export the parameters to an input-file
	for XMI-MSIM for a full Monte Carlo simulation. Access this tool through the menu (Tools -> XAS Sample Calculation) or
	as a view (Window -> Show View -> Others -> Data Analysis - XAS -> XAS Sample Calculation).
- PEEMA perspective: lazy-loading of data, Image grid viewer, Spectrum viewer.
