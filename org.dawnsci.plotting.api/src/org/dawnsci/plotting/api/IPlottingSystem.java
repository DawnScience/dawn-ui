/**
 * Represents a bridge to the plotting system.
 * 
 * To get your plotting system use the class PlottingFactory. This
 * will return the user preferred plotting.
 * 
 * To use the plotting system follow this design (similar to RCP parts in 3.x):
 * <code>
 * IPlottingSystem system = PlottingFactory.createPlottingSystem(); // reads user preference if there are alternatives.
 * 
 * In UI code
 * system.createPlotPart(...); // Note that the title here is the key used to retrieve the plotter in future.
 * 
 * Create some 1D plots in one go
 * system.createPlot1D(...); // Does not have to be in the UI thread.
 * 
 * Configure a plot in detail, does have to be in UI thread
 * ILineTrace trace = system.createLineTrace(...);
 * trace.setTraceColor(...)
 * trace.setLineWidth(...)
 * trace.setXXX(...)
 * 
 * system.addTrace(trace);
 * 
 * This is true for any trace, the paradigm is 'create, modify, add' in the trace lifecycle.
 * 
 * 
 * The plotting system uses listeners extensively to notify of the user doing things. It is likely that the
 * events in future will increase as more features become available.
 * 
 * At the end:
 * system.dispose(); // This should be called to clean up UI. Do not forget to remove listeners in the 
 *                   // dispose as well.
 *
