         title="Add a line">
      <description>
         Find a group of spots running in a line and click and drag your line profile through them. Note you can move your line after it is added by using the control points at either end or by translating it, again by clicking and dragging it.

         title="View Profile">
      <description>
         Look at the 'Line Profile' tool view on the right hand side of the image. Here you will see the intensity values of the spots which you have passed your line through.
      </description>
    <onCompletion>
      Congratulations, you can now use line profiles with images. Try with your images and with multiple lines. NOTE: If you use the masking tool, you can mask out pixels with unwanted intensity values and this profile tool will use the mask.
