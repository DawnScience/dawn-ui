      <description>
         Select the 'Box Profile' tool from the toolbar above the plot, tools labelled 'Image tools used to profile and inspect images'. These tools may be obscured on Linux if the window containing the plot is too small.

         title="Add a box">
      <description>
         Find a small group of spots and click and drag your box profile over them. Note you can move your box after it is added by using the control points or by translating it, again by clicking and dragging it. You can also add more than one box to view the profile by clicking on the 'Create new profile' button of the Box Profile tool bar.

         title="View Profile">
      <description>
         Look at the 'Box Profile' tool view on the right hand side of the image. Here you will see the intensity values of the area which you have created. The plots are the sum of x intensities and the sum of y intensities.
      </description>
    <onCompletion>
      Congratulations, you can now use box profiles with images. Try with your images and with multiple boxes. NOTE: If you use the masking tool, you can mask out pixels with unwanted intensity values and this profile tool will use the mask.
