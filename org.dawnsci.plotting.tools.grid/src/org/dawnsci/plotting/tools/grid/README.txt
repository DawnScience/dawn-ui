This plugin is a temporary one until the GridTool is fully migrated to the Unit Of Measurement usage.
For now it still uses Jscience for its unit management.

The *.grid.tree package is a temporary code replication of the classes with the same name
that have already been migrated to using the jsr-363 (Unit Of Measurement).

Once the Pixel and Resolution classes are successfully migrated to using jsr363, then the rest of
the GridTool can be migrated too.
