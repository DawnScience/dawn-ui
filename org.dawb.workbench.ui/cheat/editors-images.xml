      <subitem
            label="1. Aspect Ratio. You can change the aspect ratio of the image by using the 'Keep aspect ratio when displaying image' action in the toolbar over the image. Try clicking it now to see the effects on the example image.">
      </subitem>
      <subitem
            label="2. Change Intensity Scale. You can change how the image is filtered for intensity by clicking 'Scale the palette between maximum and minimum intenstiy in the data'. Click this action, the image goes black. Now set the range for intensity by using the min and max boxes under the image. Enter 0 and 1000 respectively. If the controls are not there they may be hidden, use the 'Set intensity controls visible or invisible' toolbar button to show them.">

         title="Zooming">
      <description>
         There are different zoom steps in the viewer. We will look at 'Zoom Area', 'Zoom line' and 'Zoom Profile'.
      </description>
      <subitem
            label="1. Zoom Area. Click on the 'Zoom Area' option in the toolbar. Click and drag an area of the image. You will see an area zoomed in the 'Zoom' view. Note that this view also has the same setting up options and toolbar and you can zoom again in this view. (If you do that the 'Apply zoom again' option on the image toolbar will reset.) ">
      </subitem>
      <subitem
            label="2. Zoom Line. Right click on the image and choose 'Zoom Line'. Click and drag a line in the image. This then shows a one-dimensional slice in the 'Line' view.">
      </subitem>
      <subitem
            label="3. Zoom Profile. Right click on the image and choose 'Zoom Profile'. Click and drag a box in the image. This then shows the profiles in x (horizontal) and y (veritcal)">

         title="Comparing">
      <description>
         You can compare images visually and by using workflow actors (there are various operations available and the processing can be done on entire folders). We will look at a simple compare between two images here.
      </description>
      <command
            required="false"
            serialization="org.eclipse.ui.navigate.openResource(filePath=data/examples/ref-testscale_1_002.img)"/>
    </item>
    <item
         title="Move Image">
      <description>
         Now we will click and drag the second image to be alongside the first. Find the tab for the image 'ref-testscale_1_002.img'. Click and hold it with the left mouse button. Now drag the mouse over to the right. You will be given the opportunity to drop the image in a new location alongside. Now parts of the two images may be zoomed and the 'Apply zoom again' button used for comparing zooms.

      Congratulations, you can now open images and complete basic operations. Try the system with your image files. Look at the 'Workflow' tutorials for more advanced mathematical operations.
