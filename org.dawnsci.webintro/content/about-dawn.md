DAWN is an open source software built on the Eclipse/RCP platform in order to scale to address a wide range of applications and to benefit from the workbench and advanced plugin system implemented in Eclipse. The main scientific domains which DAWN targets are powder diffraction, macromolecular crystallography, and tomography. Any scientific domain which needs visualisation, python and workflows can profit from DAWN.

DAWN is a Java-based open source project based on the Eclipse Rich Client Platform with its advanced plugin architecture. This gives DAWN the possibility to be extended with functionality in virtually any direction.

The main institutes developing DAWN are the [Diamond Light Source](http://www.diamond.ac.uk/), and the [European Synchrotron Radiation Facility](http://www.esrf.eu/).
