      <description>
      When the tool is opened, a cross hair is displayed as a driver to the mouse. <br/>
               Move the cursor around over the image. In the 'Pixel Information' table view you will see information about the pixel pointed to.
               A click on the plot creates a point region and its corresponding information (x, y positions, intensity, etc) is recorded in the table.<br/>
         Created point regions can be moved or deleted using the mouse .<br/>
         In each of the above operations the table view values are updated accordingly.
