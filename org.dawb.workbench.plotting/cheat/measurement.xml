         title="Measure something">
      <description>
         To measure between the peaks click and drag from one peak, letting go when you get to the next one. Repeat this between all the peaks in the file (to add each measurement, add a line region or simply press the button for the measurement tool again).

    <onCompletion>
      Congratulations, you can now measure distances in X/Y plots. Try with your own ascii files or try some plotting using a hdf5 or nexus file with one or two dimensional data.
