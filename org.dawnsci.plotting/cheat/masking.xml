         title="Select 'Masking' tool">
      <description>
         Select the 'Masking' tool from the toolbar above the plot, tools labelled 'Image tools used to profile and inspect images'. These tools may be obscured on Linux if the window containing the plot is too small.

         title="Upper and lower mask">
      <description>
         Go to the 'Masking' tool view to the right of the image and click on 'Enable lower mask' and 'Enable upper mask'. No go down to the bottom of the tool and press the 'Apply' button. You will see intensity values higher or lower than the upper and lower values will be coloured green. There is a 'Mask colour' button for changing this colour.

      <description>
      Now we will mask using direct drawing.
      </description>
          
         <subitem 
          label="Click on the &apos;Direct draw&apos; radio button. From the toolbar select &apos;Square brush&apos;."/>
          
            <subitem 
          label="Now we can draw by clicking once or clicking and dragging on the image. Notice that the pen size and shape can be changed."/>
                      
           <subitem 
           label="Experiment with holding the shift key to obtain straight lines using the direct draw brush. There is a button on the toolbar also for rubbing out mask and there is undo/redo on the main toolbar."/>

         title="Mask using regions">
      <description>
      Now we will mask using the mouse to select the mask.
      </description>
         <subitem 
          label="If you have not already, untick the upper and lower mask. Now tick 'Automatically apply mask when something changes' to apply changes automatically."/>
          
         <subitem 
          label="Click on the &apos;Regions&apos; radio button, a toolbar becomes active. From this toolbar select &apos;Continuously add the same region&apos;."/>
          
            <subitem 
          label="Now we will use polygons to mask out custom areas. Select the 'Add polygon selection' region and draw in the image by clicking several points. Double click to finish and start a new polygon."/>
          
           <subitem 
          label="You will see that polygon(s) are added and after a while the green masked pixels update. You can move this polygon and resize it. Notice that using regions for masking is not as accurate as direct draw. This is because the area that the region is covering is interpolated back to the underlying mask."/>
            
           <subitem 
           label="Experiment masking using a ring selection to take out a section of intensity by using the 'Add circle selection' action and clicking and dragging in the image."/>
   </item>

    <item
         title="Save mask">
       <description>
      We can save the mask to a buffer and re-apply it to other images. In the 'Masking' view selection there is a toolbar at the top with the tool-tip 'Save the mask into a buffer'. Select this then open the file (choose 'click to perform', below), choose the masking tool and select 'Merge the previously saved mask from buffer'. You will see your mask applied to the new image.

    <onCompletion>
      Congratulations, you can now use masking to remove certain pixels from your images. NOTE: Most other tools take into account a mask after it is created. The mask will influence the profile tools for instance.
